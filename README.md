# Bayesian Calculator

这是一个部署在GitHub Page的计算器工具，使用贝叶斯公式来计算某个信念为真的后验概率。

用户只需要估算三个数值：
1. 先验概率P(H)，也就是在出现新的证据之前，我们内心对命题H的先验主观信念。
2. 证据可能性P(E|H)（也叫边缘概率），也就是假设命题H为真，证据E出现的可能性。
3. 证伪项P(E|H')，也就是假设命题H不为真，证据E出现的可能性。

本计算器会帮你计算出后验概率 P(H|E),也就是当出现新证据E时，我们内心对于命题H的后验主观信念。
目前仅支持一轮计算。

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
